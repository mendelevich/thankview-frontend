Hello! This is my front-end coding challenge for ThankView (6/26/20). Thank you for taking the time to review it!

To run the code:

1. Run `npm start`
2. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

The code I wrote can be found in:

> `/src`
>
> > `/App.js` — Entry point for code
> >
> > `/App.css` — All styles
> >
> > `/data`
> >
> > > `/walkthroughs.json` — provided file
> >
> > `/components` — Reusable UI React components
> >
> > > `/MenuItem.js`
> > >
> > > `/VideoPlayer.js`

Some features that I'm mindful of but was not able to implement in time:

1. Did not reach the part to autoplay the next video.
2. Trimming the text on the menu items so that they don't overflow.
3. Did not add as many comments as I would have liked!
