Hello! This is my front-end coding challenge for ThankView (6/26/20). Thank you for taking the time to review it!

To run the code:

1. Run `npm start`
2. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

The code I wrote can be found:

> `/src`
>
> > `/App.js` — Entry point for code
> >
> > `/App.css` — All styles
> >
> > `/data`
> >
> > > `/walkthroughs.json` — provided file
> >
> > `/components` — Reusable UI React components
> >
> > > `/MenuItem.js`
> > >
> > > `/VideoPlayer.js`

_(This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app))_
